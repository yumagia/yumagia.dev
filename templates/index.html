<h2>ABOUT</h2> 
<p>
	<span>
	Hello! I'm a computer graphics enjoyer who's currently studying Computer Science at the University of Minnesota. I'm currently interested in all things real-time rendering. 
	I've been developing 3D engines in the Scratch language from the ground-up since before high school as a hobby of mine. Since then, I've made a few game engines in Scratch. 
	One of which, being my in-the-works engine inspired by idTech's Quake. I am also working on translating it to C++!
	Outside of programming and game development, I really like painting, and I mostly paint on digial media these days. It's a lot of fun! 
	Some of my artworks can be found scattered around this site.

	<span class="line-break"></span>
	Here are a few of my personal principles and values. I want to:
	<li>Contribute what I have to the world through my work. I want to make games which let people be happy for playing them.</li>
	<li>Uplift my peers as I uplift myself, and work to bring us towards the best possible realities.</li>
	<li>Expand my toolsets in knowledge. It's always a priority. I'm always open to learn more :)</li>
