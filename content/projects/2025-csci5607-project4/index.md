<h1 class="article-title">CSCI 5607 PROJECT 4</h1>

This project features a grid-patterned maze rendered in OpenGL using GLFW. I wasn't able to effectively complete this project, so the only features I ended up with were floors and ceilings. The engine reads a map file and creates cubic floors and ceilings from it. 

There still exists a memory leak issue in my code. 
To compile the project, run <code>make</code>.
