This project was absolutely exhilarating. My major contribution was the self-reflexive comic, which narrates a hypothetical near-future where our group was exactly one day behind our real schedule. The story culminates in our collective failure to deliver a research artifact(the comic), and thus, a collective failure to apply our critical skills of synthesis (of which our professor emphasized heavily when he first assigned this project).

I also must emphasize the role of collaboration in bringing everything together. I think I learned a lot from working with my group mates about what worked out and what was not optimal. Much of it worked out but we lacked pipelining. We had to finish one step before moving onto another, and there were many large steps that could have been parallelized. Many of these steps were further slowed by the time taken to relay various proceedings. All of this left me with less than a day's worth time to complete the artifact. In the end, I made the most of what I could do. 

Although I got extremely close to making the comic a prophecy-come-true by having no comic to submit by the start of class(the final event of the plot involves the character forgetting to present the comic, which was never actually made in the first place, anyways), I was able to complete enough of it for it to be personally satisfying. Even with that said, during the presentation, the time limit allocated for our group was simply far too limiting. We had no time to meaningfully tie the comic and the research together, or to conclude our project. This was honestly vexing, almost, because I felt like it prevented our group from bringing a performance which most truthfully reflected our work. Even the smallest reduction in time pressure could've helped astronomically. 

In the end, despite some of these pressures and non-ideal outcomes, I'm extremely glad to have learned so much about the process of research through actually collaboratively conducting it. I'm well aware that work isn't always reflected by its outcome. I feel as if this project is an instance of such a phenomenon, but this work I put in(which may also be thought of as the writing process) undeniably translated directly to experience. I regularly read research writings on my off-time, but this direct involvement by writing research of my own produces this real experience which no amount of merely reviewing research can offer. I'm grateful to have done my work to learn and grow as a writer.
